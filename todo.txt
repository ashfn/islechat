=== THIS CAR JOURNEY ===
[x] Proper channel sorting when joining with global at top then alphabetically (For now theyre not re-sorted hwen you join/create/leave a channel 80/20 rule mvp)
[x] Change banners when you change channel
[x] Member list with online and offline count for public chans and offline user list for private channels
[] Channel leave command
 - Only announces your leave if the channel is private
[x] Channel join command
 - Only announces your join if the channel is private


[x] new|make|create <name> -> name is optional but makes a new channel with you as the owner
[x] public -> makes the current channel public if you are the owner of it (anyone can join)
[x] private -> makes the current channel private if you are the owner of it (invite only)
[x] invite <user> -> invites the user to the channel if it is private (shows error if public or not owner)
[x] uninvite <user> -> revokes a users invite to the channel (shows error if public or not owner)
[x] join <channel> -> joins the channel if it is public or you are invited
[] leave -> leaves the current channel if you are not the owner and its not global
[] kick <user> -> kicks the user from the channel if your the owner
[] ban <user> -> bans he user from the channel (only works if the channel is public)
[] unban <user> -> duh
[] delete -> deletes the channel if your the owner
[x] banner <text> changes the banner of the channel

change user's channels
 -> update DB channels
 -> update channels on the users screen
 -> update member list on anyone in the channel's screen (Members list shows online users then offline users )
 
We can store a list of online users for each channel
Only show offline users in private channels


[] For this MVP version you can only be logged into an account from one session

[] dates show with full date when its >= 24h ago
[x] sign up/sign in (Just username/pass for now)
[x] nicer flow/ux like using arrows and hjjkl as well as tab to focus different boxes

[] keybinds show at the bottom and are context based
